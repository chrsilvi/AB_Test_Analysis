# AB_Test_Analysis
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree A/B Test Project

This is a project I did while completing the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
A fictional website wanted to test a new version, so this walks through
analyzing the data and performing a hypothesis test based on that data.
The initial commit is just the base files given as part of the project,
and then updates from there as I work to complete it.
